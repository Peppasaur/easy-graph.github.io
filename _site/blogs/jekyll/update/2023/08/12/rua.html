<p>A graph is a primitive representation of relationships between entities, and it allows for a profound and direct understanding of the associations in the world. Typical applications of graph data include social networks, transaction data, knowledge graphs, transportation systems, biotechnology, and etcetera.Social networks are a specific type of graph data which is built upon the foundation of graph networks and guided by certain sociological theories.</p>

<p>Graph Analysis focuses on analyzing the strength and direction of relationships between entities in graph data, thereby uncovering features and assisting in decision-making.</p>

<p>EasyGraph is an open-source graph analysis package based on the Python language, developed by the MSN team at Fudan University. <strong>Compared to existing open-source libraries focusing on graph analysis such as igraph and NetworkX, EasyGraph offers a more comprehensive set of social network analysis methods grounded in sociological theories.</strong> Its main functionalities include the following:</p>
