A graph is a primitive representation of relationships between entities, and it allows for a profound and direct understanding of the associations in the world. Typical applications of graph data include social networks, transaction data, knowledge graphs, transportation systems, biotechnology, and etcetera.Social networks are a specific type of graph data which is built upon the foundation of graph networks and guided by certain sociological theories.

Graph Analysis focuses on analyzing the strength and direction of relationships between entities in graph data, thereby uncovering features and assisting in decision-making.

EasyGraph is an open-source graph analysis package based on the Python language, developed by the MSN team at Fudan University. **Compared to existing open-source libraries focusing on graph analysis such as igraph and NetworkX, EasyGraph offers a more comprehensive set of social network analysis methods grounded in sociological theories.** Its main functionalities include the following:

1. The first open-source library that includes a comprehensive set of structural hole spanner detection methods (for more understanding of the structural hole theory: [Structural Hole Theory in Social Network Analysis: A Review | IEEE Journals & Magazine | IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9406195))

2. Graph embedding algorithms like DeepWalk, Node2Vec, LINE, SDNE, etc.

3. Classic network algorithms for community detection, centrality analysis, component analysis, clustering, etc.

4. Improved runtime efficiency through hybrid programming and parallel computing.

5. A collection of visualization methods for complex networks.

6. Including various classic datasets.

   ​

   With this architecture, EasyGraph can be applied in various domains such as biology, transportation, chemistry, social sciences, ecology, and more for graph data analysis.
